# Task
Create an Android "screen" that would allow a user to enter and submit the following data from an American Express, Discover, MasterCard, or Visa credit card:

Credit card number
Expiration date (MM/YY format)
CVV security code
First name
Last name
See GIF attached below:



If any of the entered data was invalid, the user needed to be notified so they could correct it. In addition to not having issues like empty fields or badly-formed or expired expiration date, credit card data also had to meet these criteria to be considered valid:

Credit card numbers needed to be in a valid American Express, Discover, MasterCard, or Visa format 
Credit card numbers also needed to pass Luhn validation - see Luhn algorithm
The CVV had to meet these criteria: CVV Number
First and last names could only contain characters that were "alphabetical and spaces"
When the user-submitted valid credit card data, the app should pop up an alert dialogue notifying them that the payment was successful.
